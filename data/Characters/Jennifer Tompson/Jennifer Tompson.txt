Background:
	
Born into a family with a lot of problems, 
Jennifer often found herself jumping into her Mazda and running away.
When her parents found out she was gone, they would call the cops and have her arrested. 
Though she was eventually caught, her amazing driving skills made her almost escape a 50 police unit chase.
After a couple years in a NY state penitentiary, Jennifer went to Binghamton University, where she majors in nursing.
Unfortunately, her little brother Frank fell gravely ill with cancer and her parents cannot afford the treatment.
Faced with such situations, Jennifer found herself wagering money against other racers in order to pay for her brother's hospital bills.
