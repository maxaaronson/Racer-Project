Tommy first started racing at the age of 18, 
where he would steal his rich father's cars in order to beat the competition.
After Graduating from college, Tommy became one of the richest stockbrokers in New york.
With that much money in his pockets, his cars are extremely fast and he can afford a dent or two.
A year after his father's death, Tommy went into a violent self-destructive path which lead him to rehab.
After getting a lot of help, he stopped doing drugs, and focused all of his anger and sadness into racing.
